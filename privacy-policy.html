    <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
    <p>When you use Chessy, we collect your Discord user ID, username, avatar URL, and match-related data (e.g., scheduled times and results). We also gather usage metrics such as command frequency and channel IDs where the bot operates :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}.</p>

    <h2>2. How We Use Your Information</h2>
    <p>We use collected data solely to schedule matches, display countdowns, generate leaderboards, and improve the bot’s functionality. We may aggregate metrics for analytics and feature development; no personal data is sold or shared :contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4}.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>3. Data Sharing & Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>We do not share personal data with third parties, except (a) to comply with legal obligations or (b) to trusted service providers (e.g., database hosting) under NDA. Any such provider processes data only on our behalf and under our instructions :contentReference[oaicite:5]{index=5}.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>4. Data Retention</h2>
