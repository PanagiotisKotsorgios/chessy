Chessy Terms of Service
=======================

Effective date: **April 23, 2025**

1\. Acceptance of Terms
-----------------------

By using the Chessy Discord application (“Chessy”, “we”, “our”), you agree to these Terms of Service. If you do not agree, please do not use the app.

2\. Use of the Service
----------------------

Chessy allows Discord server members to schedule and play chess matches, display countdowns, and view profile-based leaderboards. You agree to use Chessy only for lawful purposes and in compliance with Discord’s Terms of Service.

3\. User Content
----------------

All user‐generated content (profile pictures, usernames, match history) remains the property of the user. By using Chessy, you grant us a non-exclusive license to display that content within Discord.

4\. Privacy
-----------

We collect only the minimal data required to run matches (e.g., Discord IDs, timestamps). For full details, see our [Privacy Policy](/privacy-policy.html).

5\. Modifications
-----------------

We may modify these Terms at any time. Continued use of Chessy after changes constitutes acceptance of the new Terms.

6\. Termination
---------------

We reserve the right to suspend or terminate your access if you violate these Terms or Discord’s policies.

7\. Contact Us
