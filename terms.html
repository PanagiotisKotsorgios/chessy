  <h1>Chessy Terms of Service</h1>
  <p>Effective date: <strong>April 23, 2025</strong></p>

  <section>
    <h2>1. Acceptance of Terms</h2>
    <p>By using the Chessy Discord application (“Chessy”, “we”, “our”), you agree to these Terms of Service. If you do not agree, please do not use the app.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>2. Use of the Service</h2>
    <p>Chessy allows Discord server members to schedule and play chess matches, display countdowns, and view profile-based leaderboards. You agree to use Chessy only for lawful purposes and in compliance with Discord’s Terms of Service.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>3. User Content</h2>
    <p>All user‐generated content (profile pictures, usernames, match history) remains the property of the user. By using Chessy, you grant us a non-exclusive license to display that content within Discord.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>4. Privacy</h2>
    <p>We collect only the minimal data required to run matches (e.g., Discord IDs, timestamps). For full details, see our <a href="/privacy-policy.html">Privacy Policy</a>.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>5. Modifications</h2>
    <p>We may modify these Terms at any time. Continued use of Chessy after changes constitutes acceptance of the new Terms.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>6. Termination</h2>
    <p>We reserve the right to suspend or terminate your access if you violate these Terms or Discord’s policies.</p>
