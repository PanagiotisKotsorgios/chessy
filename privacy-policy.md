Effective date: **April 23, 2025**

1\. Information We Collect
--------------------------

When you use Chessy, we collect your Discord user ID, username, avatar URL, and match-related data (e.g., scheduled times and results). We also gather usage metrics such as command frequency and channel IDs where the bot operates :contentReference\[oaicite:3\]{index=3}.

3\. Data Sharing & Third-Party Services
---------------------------------------

We do not share personal data with third parties, except (a) to comply with legal obligations or (b) to trusted service providers (e.g., database hosting) under NDA. Any such provider processes data only on our behalf and under our instructions :contentReference\[oaicite:5\]{index=5}.
